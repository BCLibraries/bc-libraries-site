<p>Wednesday, November 18, 4:30 p.m. <br />
Thompson Room, John J. Burns Library</p>

 
<p>Please join us for a lecture by Rev. James H. Murphy, C.M., Professor of English at DePaul University and Fall 2015 Burns Visiting Scholar in Irish Studies.  A historian of fiction as well as political historian, Professor Murphy will address questions that have emerged from his latest research on the Victorian period in Ireland and its aftermath:</p>


<p>What role did the Dublin Corporation, or city council, play in the national politics of Victorian Ireland, and how did it affect its service to the city’s population?</p>


<p>What agendas did women novelists of the period pursue? What kinds of feminisms did they advocate in their fictions?</p>


<p>What novels, as yet unrecognized, may have influenced James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man?</p>


<p>The Center for Irish Programs and the Boston College University Libraries cordially invite you to attend a reception honoring Professor Murphy immediately following his lecture in the Irish Room of the John J. Burns Library.</p>
