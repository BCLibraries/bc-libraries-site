<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Digital Humanities, as a community of theory and practice, is continually shaping and reshaping itself. In this talk, Bauer will discuss ways a campus community can think about finding the "DH" that is right for them and how to put it into practice. Topics touched on will include: human and cyber infrastructure for healthy DH projects, finding the right institutional "home" or virtual space for DH on a campus, working with stakeholders including departments, the Library, and Central IT, and how DH has the potential to change a campus culture toward true interdisciplinary and mutually beneficial partnerships. </p>
