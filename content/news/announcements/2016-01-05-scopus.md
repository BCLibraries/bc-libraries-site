<p>If you are in the literature review phase of your graduate degree at Boston College and can spare 15 hours over the next few months (through  April 15, 2016), then consider applying for this special graduate student stipend.  The Boston College Libraries have a year-long subscription to <a href="http://proxy.bc.edu/login?url=http://www.scopus.com" target="_blank">Scopus</a>, a database similar to <a href="http://proxy.bc.edu/login?url=http://isiknowledge.com/wos" target="_blank">Web of Science</a>.  We are looking for graduate students in the sciences and social sciences for the following tasks in comparing/contrasting these two multidisciplinary resources:</p>

<ul>

	<li>Attend training sessions for each database (Scopus:  Jan. 27 at either 11am or 2pm;  Web of Science:  Feb. 3 at either 11am or 2pm)</li>
    <li>Conduct your own research in each database and record your findings/observations </li>
    <li>Conduct research by two authors in your field in each database</li>
    <li>Attend a mid-project check-in session</li>
    <li>Participate in a departmental pizza party with fellow grad students in your discipline, to talk about the two databases</li>
    <li>Be available as a resource to others in your department as they try out each database</li>
    <li>Write a brief, final report</li>
    <li>Participate in a focus group with the other graduate students to discuss your findings/reactions</li>
</ul>

<p>This project will benefit your own research, while helping the Libraries and the Boston College Community. For more detailed information and to apply, please email <a href="mailto:sally.wyman@bc.edu">Sally Wyman</a>.  First consideration granted to students who contact us by <strong>Friday, January 22, 2016</strong>.</p>
