Join us in celebrating Jane Jacobs' 100th birthday with Robert Kanigel, author of a new biography of the activist, journalist, and pioneer of urban planning and city design, whose archives are held in Burns Library.

Jane's centenary is being celebrated nationwide, with a documentary film, an opera, the Jane Jacobs Centennial Lecture Series, and Jane Jacobs walking tours all over the country, among others. But while many have written about Jane's life, ideas, and writing, no one has drawn all of these threads together in a definitive portrait until now. 

Kanigel is the author of seven previous books--including <em>The Man Who Knew Infinity</em>, which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize--and the recipient of numerous awards, including a Guggenheim fellowship. 

<strong>Highlights from the Jane Jacobs Papers, held by the Burns Library, will be on view. </strong>

For further information, including directions and parking, please call (617) 552-3282.
