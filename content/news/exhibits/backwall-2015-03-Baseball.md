<p>Baseball&rsquo;s League of Nations chronicles the little known history of   Native Americans&rsquo; contribution to baseball, including an examination of   Native American logos and mascots, how baseball was used to assimilate   Native American children into American culture, and the barnstorming   teams of the 20th century. It continues to the present with   contemporary major league players such as pitcher Joba Chamberlain,   Winnebago, pitcher Kyle Lohse, Nomlaki, and centerfielder Jacoby   Ellsbury, Navajo.<br>
</p>
<p>A half century before Jackie Robinson officially integrated America&rsquo;s   National Pastime, Louis Sockalexis, a Native American of the Penobscot   Nation, played outfield for the Major League Cleveland Spiderâ€”the year,   1897.</p>
