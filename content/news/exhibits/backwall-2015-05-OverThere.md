This exhibit tells the story of the effect of the First World War as it may be gleaned from archival sources available in the University's special collections, housed in the John J. Burns Library. These documents provide a wealth of information on the life (and death) of "B.C. boys," as they came to be known, during the war, as well as the impact the conflict had on their Alma mater.
