Data, data, data -- it's truly everywhere, and it&rsquo;s growing.  We collect   more and more of it (think "Big Data"), and we're storing almost all of   it digitally -- and all of it is at risk without good care and   management.  Boston College's research data is one of its "primary   assets".  Like other academic research institutions, Boston College is   responding to the proliferation of federal and publisher <strong>mandates </strong>for better data management practice and growing recognition of the<strong> enormous risk data loss poses</strong>.
