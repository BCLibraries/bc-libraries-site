<p>"This exhibit highlights the works of a limited number of 20th and 21st   century black artists who have lived, studied (and in many cases,   taught), and created in the greater Boston area.  The paintings,   sculptures, and other works seen here might be described as   representational or abstract, as politically charged or personally   spiritual, as somber or light-hearted.  The techniques, subjects and   tone are as varied as the backgrounds of the artists themselves.  What   brings them together here is their association with Boston.  Strong fine   arts programs at several local universities and the School of the   Museum of Fine Arts, and the concentration of museums (the MFA, the   Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists, the Institute of   Contemporary Art) and galleries attract talented artists to this city.    The black artists featured here, together with countless others living   and working in Boston, demonstrate the cultural enrichment we all enjoy   thanks to that attraction."</p>
