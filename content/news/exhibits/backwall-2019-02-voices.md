Boston College O'Neill Library is the site of an interactive, travelling exhibition featuring filmed testimonies of 30 political activists, historians and civilians who experienced the 1968 civil rights movement and political tensions in Northern Ireland.  Using the words of those directly involved at the time, the <em>Voices of '68</em> exhibition provides a fresh look at this crucial turning point in Northern Ireland's political and social history.  

On February 21st, a panel of historians will discuss the exhibit and the relationships between the Civil Rights Movement in the US and similar movements in other countries.  Panelists include Chris Reynolds, PhD- Nottingham Trent University; Karen Miller, PhD- Boston College; and Robert Savage, PhD- Boston College.

Richard Cushnie, Deputy Director/First Secretary of the Northern Ireland Bureau (Northern Ireland's diplomatic representation in the US), remarks- "There is a direct line between the events of 1968 in the US and the development of a civil rights movement in Northern Ireland. The connections between NI and the US are strong, and I'm delighted that Boston College is exploring another aspect of our deep relationship through this important exhibition."

The exhibition is a collaborative project between National Museums NI and Dr. Chris Reynolds from Nottingham Trent University. The project includes filmed testimonies capturing the personal accounts of the 1968 events.  Other elements of the project include educational resources and a series of extended videos that allow visitors to explore this seminal moment in Northern Ireland's recent history.

The BC installation and panel discussion are co-sponsored by the Boston College Libraries, the Boston College Institute for the Liberal Arts, the Northern Ireland Bureau, the Boston College Irish Institute, the Boston College History Department, and Boston College African and African Diaspora Studies.

Karen Logan, Project Curator at National Museums NI comments - "Voices of '68 has been a significant collaboration dedicated to highlighting the living legacies of a time in history that challenged Northern Irish society.  We hope that the exhibitions and talks throughout the exhibition will encourage conversations around the wider issues of human rights and political reform and that the actions of the past will help inform all communities."

Dr Chris Reynolds of Nottingham Trent University states - "It has been a privilege to work with National Museums NI on this project. The Ulster Museum houses a wealth of historical archives that tell an important story about conflict, communities and peacebuilding.  The exhibition offers a snapshot of the people who were involved in or witnessed social and political events across Northern Ireland fifty years ago, and how testimonies can educate and resonate with a wide generation of visitors from all backgrounds."
