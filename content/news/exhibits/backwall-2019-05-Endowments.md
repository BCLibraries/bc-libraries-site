Each year the collections of the Boston College Libraries are enriched by the generosity and foresight of benefactors who created endowed funds to support library collections. Each fall, O’Neill Library bibliographers work with faculty across the disciplines to select materials fitting the guidelines of each fund. Often, this is the only way that the Libraries can acquire these important, expensive resources. Materials purchased this year continued the expansion of our U.S. periodical and newspaper access with the addition of <em>Early American Newspapers, Series 4, 1756-1922: The Rise of Industry</em>. We also added access to 12 historical Chinese news titles through the acquisition of <em>ProQuest Chinese Newspapers</em> (1832 - 1953). Economists in every discipline will benefit from access to The Economist Digital Archive. Materials for comparative religion studies are also well-represented, as are resources focused on peace studies. Researchers in Women’s and Gender Studies and other disciplines will benefit from access to <em>Women and Social Movements International, 1840 to present</em>. Scholarship and teaching in the Connell School of Nursing will be well-served by access to the American Nurses Association Book Collection. Brain researchers gained access to important reference resources, and chemists now have access to new e-books from the Royal Society of Chemistry. These are just a few examples of the wide-ranging benefits that accrue to the Boston College community from the generosity of our library benefactors. With much gratitude, the O’Neill Library displays its new resources in this exhibit.
