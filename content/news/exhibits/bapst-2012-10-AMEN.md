<p><em>The AMEN Project </em>started in response to a   church burning incident in Gireif, a residential area in Khartoum, Sudan   which occurred earlier this year in April.  Sudanese/Amercian artist   Khalid Kodi, adjunct professor of the Fine Arts Department at Boston   College, initiated the project with the help of a multi-religious and   multi-ethnic team of artists who are students at Boston College.  The   team spent Summer 2012 working on a series of large-scale, high-quality   biblical paintings as part of a greater effort to rebuild the Church in   Khartoum. The project is firmly rooted in universal principles of and   commitment to peaceful co-existence and social justice.</p>
<p>In addition to painting, the AMEN Project conducted interviews with   leaders in the fields of education and religion; Dr. Abdel-Rahman   Ibrahim Mohamed, Father David Hollenbach, S.J, Professor Catherine   Cornille, Professor John Michalczyk, Professor Crystal Tiala, and Father   Raymond Helmick, S.J. who commented on the meanings of the church   burning incident, and on the response Professor Kodi and his students   initiated. These interviews are available to watch online on the <a href="http://www.amen-projects.com/">AMEN project website.</a></p>
