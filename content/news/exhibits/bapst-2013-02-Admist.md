Sammy Chongâ€™s recent body of work focuses on the notion of social, physical, and spiritual disengagement in public spaces. Shopping malls, airports, and train stations connote forms of solitude, linked to the ever-expanding conglomeration of modern society. By leaving painted sections of seemingly banal scenes in oils and acrylics on Plexiglas panels, Chong invites the viewer to gain awareness of the meditative nature of being both immersed and removed from the activity around us.
