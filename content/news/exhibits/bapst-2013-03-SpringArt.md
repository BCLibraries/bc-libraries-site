The <em>Spring Student Art Show</em> is a celebration of student artwork   on campus and a creation of space for students, faculty, and the public   to converse about their artwork. This is an opportunity for all to   communicate through the vessel of art, whether it is the visual arts,   poetry, theater, or music
