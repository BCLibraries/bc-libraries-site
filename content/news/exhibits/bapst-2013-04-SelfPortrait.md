The idea for this exhibition was proposed by Professor Sammy Chong,   S.J., whose &ldquo;Art of Portraiture&rdquo; class was introduced this semester. The   majority of the works were created by Professor Chong&rsquo;s students,   though the exhibition includes works from the entire BC student body.   The works emphasize the formal elements of portrait-making as well as   the underlying theoretical concepts. In some cases portraits can be   considered as &ldquo;likenesses&rdquo; that have been constructed in such a way as   to convey a certain feeling or sensation via their formal elements. In   other cases, portraits rely more on the psychological effect of the   subject and less on the creation of a believable &ldquo;likeness.&rdquo; This   exhibition displays the breadth which the field of portraiture has to   offer through the hands of BC artists.
