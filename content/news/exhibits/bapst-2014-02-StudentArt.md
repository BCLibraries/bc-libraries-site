With the <em>Spring Student Show 2014</em>, BC&rsquo;s Art Club aims to   physically manifest its mission: to bring a greater awareness and   appreciation of art to the greater Boston College community. With that   mission in mind, all students, regardless of school or major, were   invited to submit their work, with the hope of providing an audience and   exhibit space for students who otherwise would not have a platform for   their work. Consequently, the exhibit displays work by artists from   across the disciplines at our university in many different types of   media.
