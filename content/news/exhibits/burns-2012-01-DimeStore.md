<p>In the late 1800s it was discovered that cheaply printed, serially   published stories with snazzy, color covers – which could be mailed at a   steep discount and were particularly marketed to young men – would sell   like hotcakes at 5¢ each. And, although they were considered by   responsible-type people to be a waste of time and money (and a terrible   influence on the morals of those who read them) they flourished until   postal rates changed…..and 5¢ could get a kid into the movies instead.</p>
  
<p>The dime novels of the Burns Library include only a small fraction of   the myriad series issued by publishers Frank Tousey and Street &amp;   Smith of New York. Six series are represented here. All are in the   category &quot;nickel weeklies&quot;. Authors of nickel weeklies were identified   by pen names and each pen name could be used by numerous authors. The   creators of the wonderful cover illustrations are not identified. The   social biases and stereotypical beliefs of many Americans at the turn of   the twentieth century are on painfully full view in both cover and   text. National ideals of self-reliance, loyalty, ingenuity, bravery and   patriotism are here as well.</p>

 <p>Jack   Wright - the boy inventor - appeared in the Frank Tousey series &quot;Pluck   &amp; Luck: Complete Stories of Adventure&quot; from 1891-1904. All 120   stories featuring Jack were authored by Luis Senarens (1863-1939)   writing as &quot;Noname.&quot; Jack is one of the &quot;Edisonade&quot; heroes of dime   novels. His incredible inventions are vehicles he uses to access every   part of the globe. From his murdered father, Mad Bill, Jack has   inherited an obsession with exploration of the ocean floor, and he has   earned a fortune through his adventures. His sidekicks are Timothy   Topstay and Fritz Schneider. The series is considered an early example   of the science fiction genre, and its connection to the steampunk   aesthetic is clear.</p>
  
<img title="Red Raven cover" alt="Red Raven cover" src="/theme/img/exhibits/burns/2012/01-dimestore-red.jpg" class="float_right"  />
  
<p>On their ship, the <em>Red Raven</em>,   Thad Fergus and his pals Oliver and Simon battle pirate after pirate   after pirate. Foes include Blackbeard, Morgan, Kidd, and others. &quot;The   Red Raven Library: Stirring Tales of Old Buccaneer Days&quot; was published   in 1905. The pen name &quot;An Old Salt&quot; was used by authors Thomas C.   Harbaugh (1849-1924) and John DeMorgan (1848-1926). &quot;The Red Raven   Library&quot; was published by the Winner Company, an imprint of Street &amp;   Smith, New York.</p>
  
<img title="Paul Jones cover" alt="Paul Jones cover" src="/theme/img/exhibits/burns/2012/01-dimestore-jones.jpg" class="float_left" />
  
 <p>&quot;The   Red Raven Library&quot; was continued by &quot;Paul Jones Weekly: Stories of the   American Revolution&quot;. Nineteen issues were authored by William Wallace   Cook (1867-1933) and John DeMorgan under the pen name &quot;Capt. Luther   Barr,&quot; from 1905-1906. The series' change in direction from &quot;Red Raven&quot;   to &quot;Paul Jones&quot; occurred at the time when the remains of American   Revolutionary War hero John Paul Jones were being returned with great   ceremony to the United States from an obscure burial location in Paris.   &quot;Paul Jones Weekly&quot; was published by the Winner Company, an imprint of   Street &amp; Smith, New York.</p>
  
<img title="Boys of 76" alt="Boys of 76" src="/theme/img/exhibits/burns/2012/01-dimestore-boys.jpg" class="float_right" />
  
 <p>&quot;The   Liberty Boys of '76': A Weekly Magazine Containing Stories of the   American Revolution&quot; was penned by &quot;Harry Moore,&quot; pseudonym of authors   Cecil Burleigh (1859-1921) and Stephen Angus Douglas Cox (1865-1944).   Over 600 stories were published by Frank Tousey, from 1901-1925. The   Revolutionary War was a popular theme of dime novels. In this series,   hero Dick Slater and best friend bob Estabrook, lead their militia unit,   the <em>Liberty Boys of '76'</em> as it aids every imaginable patriot,   engages in nearly every battle, and foils every conceivable foe of the   new nation. The boys additionally spend time on the frontier, fighting   adversaries including Native Americans.</p>
 
<img title="Secret Service cover" alt="Secret Service cover" src="/theme/img/exhibits/burns/2012/01-dimestore-secret.jpg" class="float_left" />
  
 <p>&quot;Secret   Service: Old and Young King Brady, Detectives&quot; was published by Frank   Tousey from 1899-1912, but detective stories featuring Brady were   produced beginning in 1885. Francis W. Doughty (1850-1917) was the   series' first author; others were Walter Fenton Mott, Luis Senarens, and   Lurana Shelton. The pen name &quot;A New York Detective&quot; was used by all.   The leading characters of these tales are the Irish-American, ex-New   York police detective, James Brady, and his partners Harry Brady (no   relation) and Alice Montgomery. The location of the action can be almost   anywhere, but the series is especially known for its scenes of New York   City and the Chinatown neighborhoods of both New York and San   Francisco.</p>
  
<img title="Nick Carter cover" alt="Nick Carter cover" src="/theme/img/exhibits/burns/2012/01-dimestore-nick.jpg" class="float_right" />
  
<p>New   York City-based detective Nick Carter first appeared as a main   character in dime novels in 1891, having made an earlier, supporting   appearance in &quot;New York Weekly&quot; in 1886. Nick Carter continued his   exploits in various Street &amp; Smith dime novels for many years. Pulp   magazines featuring Carter were also published, but his career outlasted   that format as well – he can be found in paperback novels from the   1960s to 1990, having evolved into the 007-type character &quot;Nick Carter,   Killmaster.&quot;  Over the years, the character was featured on the radio   and in the movies. Numerous authors contributed stories to this   long-running series of series. The &quot;Nick Carter Weekly&quot; (with a few   title variations including &quot;New Nick Carter Weekly&quot;, seen here) was   published from 1897-1912.</p>
  
<p><em>The nickel weeklies exhibited here are typical examples, with   color covers and 28-32 double-column pages of text per issue. The text   is printed on cheaply produced, acidic, pulp paper which is   deteriorating at a fast rate.</em></p>

<p><em>The magazines are quite fragile but may be used with care at the   Burns Library. They are held off-site and must be requested in advance.   Contact the Burns Library Reading Room at <a href="mailto:burnsref@bc.edu">burnsref@bc.edu</a> or call 617-552-4861.</em></p>
