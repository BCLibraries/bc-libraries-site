<p>In April of 1911, in an article in <em>The Catholic Book Bulletin: A Monthly Review of Catholic Literature </em>entitled<em>, </em>&quot;A   Domestic Library and Other Things,&quot; Mrs. Coleman offers advice to Mr.   O'Doherty of Donegal and other persons seeking to set up a family   library.</p>
<p>Mrs. Coleman's recommendations are ones that seek to foster formation   of the soul, mind, and heart, particularly for the Catholic population   in Ireland. The titles and items featured in this exhibit reflect the   recommendations of Mrs. Coleman. The items displayed here are fancier   and of a much higher quality than the same titles or objects that would   have appeared in the homes of the rural or urban working class Irish in   1911. The selections, however, reveal the importance of the Church and   devotional practices, the study of Irish history, literature, language,   music, and other arts as the Irish seek to reclaim all aspects of Irish   knowledge and culture and to begin to build a nation.</p>
