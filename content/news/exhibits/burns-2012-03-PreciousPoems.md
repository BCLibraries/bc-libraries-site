The John J. Burns Library presents a selection of the Traffic Street books so that you may admire the physical beauty of the books and be inspired by the imaginative, humorous, and touching poems inside each of them!  Featured with the Traffic Street books are items of related historic interest from the John J. Burns Library special collections.
