<p>Bandleader,   impresario, and composer P.S. Gilmore helped create music traditions   that resonate in American culture today, with particular relevance to   Boston. In the latter half of the 19th century, Gilmore expanded public   listening environments, broadened repertoire, and master-minded jubilee   festivals of unprecedented scope. The Irish-born Gilmore also wrote the   well-known song, &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p>Summer 2012 marks the 140th anniversary of the World's Peace Jubilee   and International Music Festival, organized by Gilmore and held June   17-July 4 1872 in Boston, Massachusetts.
