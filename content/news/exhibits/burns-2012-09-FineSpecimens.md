The Boston College University Libraries regularly host exhibitions related to the institution’s collections. This fall an exhibition of significant bookbindings will be featured in the John J. Burns Library. The show, a handsome group of books in a variety of styles from a wide span of years, also represents the many different subjects in the Library’s collections.
