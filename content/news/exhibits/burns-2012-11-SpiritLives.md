<p>Born Inigo Lopez de Loyola (1491-1556), St. Ignatius developed the   Spiritual Exercises, a month-long program of meditations, prayers, and   contemplative practices. He was the founder and first leader of the   Society of Jesus, a Catholic religious order dedicated to service   through education and ministries. The Jesuits in New England faced   opposition early on, but they were steadfast and earnest in their   mission. Boston College – both in the early days and as the University   we know today – represents the spirit of St. Ignatius. This Boston   College Sesquicentennial exhibit highlights the early champions of the   idea of a Jesuit college in Boston, books used in the Boston College   19th century curriculum, Catholic faith-focused student organizations,   and the legacy of Boston College Jesuits.<br />
