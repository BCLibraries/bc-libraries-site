Within the collections at the Burns Library, there are expressions warmth in letters exchanged between admirers, families, and colleagues. Inscriptions in books given as gifts reveal the same kind feelings. During the frosty winter months in New England, we hope to be cozy, protected from the elements, and at ease with our colleagues and friends. With any luck, a glimpse at the tender words of others will help us through the coldest of seasons.
