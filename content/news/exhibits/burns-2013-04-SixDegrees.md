In historical Boston, it seems like everybody knew everybody else, and even six degrees of separation is more than you need to connect any two figures. This exhibit examines the many interconnections in the Boston-related archival collections made newly available to researchers in the past year as part of a Burns Library processing project. Come by and see what connects charming con artist "Handsome Jack" Hapgood to John F. Kennedy, or Boston Public Library head Philip J. McNiff, flamboyant local restaurant owner Bette Arnold, and Queen Elizabeth II!
