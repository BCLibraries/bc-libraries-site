<p>IMMIGRATION, CRIME, SOCIAL WELFARE, CULTURE: how did   nineteenth-century Bostonians shape and respond, alone and together, to   the changing urban landscape? This exhibit explores personal and   collective responses to a city swept first by immigrants, then by fire,   forced to reinvent itself as a both physical and social space. On   display are a selection of print and manuscript documents representing   individual, institutional, and governmental responses to the challenges   and opportunities presented by life in a dense, diverse, and growing   city. The exhibit features diaries of 19th-century citizens, theatre   broadsides and scrapbooks, the published reports of social service   agencies concerned with health and welfare, records kept by the Boston   Police Department,  immigrant financial records, and images of the Great   Fire of 1872.</p>
<p>Building the urban landscape – with bricks and mortar, and with   services and organizations – left a documentary trail in libraries and   archives throughout the region. Boston College, now celebrating its   sesquicentennial, was collecting Boston material from its beginnings in   the South End. The Burns Library historical Bostoniana collection also   owes much to the generosity and foresight of two donors: Ellerton J.   Brehaut (d. 1985), an avid collector and proud promoter of Boston who   served at the Boston Chamber of Commerce from 1919 to 1959, witnessing   enormous changes in the city, and John T. and Ruth M. Galvin, who   established an endowment for the acquisition material documenting Boston   political history.  </p>
