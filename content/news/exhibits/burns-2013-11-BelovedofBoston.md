 <p>John Boyle O'Reilly was born in 1844 in Dowth,   County Meath, Ireland. He apprenticed in newspaper writing, publishing   and printing before immigrating to England at age fifteen to work at an   uncle's paper in Preston. At the request of his father, he returned to   Ireland in 1863 and at that time he became involved with the Irish   Republican Brotherhood (later called the Fenian Brotherhood) in support   of Irish independence. O'Reilly joined the 10th Hussars regiment of the   British army stationed in Dublin. He recruited clandestinely within the   regiment and eventually brought 80 fellow soldiers into the Fenian   movement. Upon discovery O'Reilly was arrested and convicted in July   1866 of conspiracy to incite military mutiny. He was transported along   with sixty-one brother Fenians to Western Australia in 1867.<br />
  </p>
  <p>O'Reilly made a daring escape in March of 1869 on the New Bedford   whaler, the Gazelle, arriving in Philadelphia after a host of dangerous   exploits along the route. He established contact with American Fenians,   and though he disagreed with the way the group was led and organized,   and ultimately disengaged, he supported Irish Nationalism and remained   friendly with his former colleagues. With these he collaborated to plan   the rescue of six Fenians from Western Australia in 1876 on the New   Bedford whaling ship, the Catalpa.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Still a young man, O'Reilly settled in Boston and enjoyed success   with writing and publishing, becoming editor of the Pilot, the country's   foremost Catholic newspaper, in 1874. The paper had a national weekly   circulation of 103,000, offering news on political developments in   Ireland to its subscribers, the majority of whom were Irish immigrants.   He married Mary Murphy of Charlestown, with whom he had three daughters.   His writings professed love of family, and some of his poetry attests   to his beautiful thoughts on love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>O'Reilly crossed great social and ethnic divides with warmth and   grace and was effective in fostering better relations between long-term   New Englanders of the Protestant faith and Irish Catholic immigrants in   the city. A great proponent of good citizenship O'Reilly urged fellow   Irishmen and women and other immigrants to become active in American   political and civic life.</p>
  <p>Not only an avid advocate of Irish independence, O'Reilly was   passionate about equality and equity for the downtrodden and all victims   of racial, ethnic, class, and religious discrimination and oppression.   O'Reilly worked to raise the consciousness of his readers about poverty   and human misery. He defended the right to organize, called for   legislation on such issues as minimum wages, compulsory arbitration, and   more effective factory inspection procedures to ensure safety and   limits on child and female labor.</p>
  <p>O'Reilly died in 1890 and a public monument on the Fenway in Boston   speaks to the high regard in which he was held. The committee to erect   the monument hired Daniel Chester French who designed the Lincoln   Memorial in Washington, D.C. The proposed $20,000.00 fee to do the work   was raised by public subscriptions, yet another testament to how   Bostonians loved John Boyle O'Reilly.</p>
