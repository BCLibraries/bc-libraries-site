<p>Seamus Heaney (1939 – 2013) was an Irish poet, playwright, translator   and lecturer, and the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in   1995 &quot;for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt   everyday miracles and the living past.&quot;</p>
<p>Heaney's poetry reflects a gift for creating warm, long-lasting   relationships, and an ability to evoke nature using a few   brilliantly-chosen words. In his poems, many of which dwell upon the   natural world, Heaney offers unique ways of &quot;seeing things&quot; in the   people and the environment surrounding us.  Selected fine press books   and limited edition broadsides enhance the visual aspect of what Malcolm   Jones of <em>Newsweek</em> described as &quot;Heaney's own poetic vernacular -   muscular language so rich with the tones and smell of earth that you   almost expect to find a few crumbs of dirt clinging to his lines ...&quot;</p>
<p>Heaney made a number of visits to Boston College, including seven   Humanities Series appearances. Two letters written by Heaney to Fr.   Sweeney (director of the Humanities Series from 1958 to 1998) show the   warm familiarity Heaney had with the Boston College community. Heaney's   approachable demeanor is evident in a 1998 group photograph with Boston   College graduate students and in two portraits from the Bobbie Hanvey   Photographic Archives.</p>
