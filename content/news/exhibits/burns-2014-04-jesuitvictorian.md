On the occasion of the 125th anniversary of his death, Boston College celebrates in 2014 one of the most influential Victorian poets, the Jesuit Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844-1889).

Two important events will mark this celebration. An exhibition of unique items from Burns Library collection related to GMH and his family and a public lecture on the impact of Jesuit spirituality on Hopkins's poetry by Dr. Paul Mariani on 30 September, 4pm. 

A reception for the exhibition will be held on April 16, 4-6pm, with brief remarks by the curators: Barbara Adams Hebard, Dr. Robert A. Maryks, and Dr. Jude V. Nixon.
