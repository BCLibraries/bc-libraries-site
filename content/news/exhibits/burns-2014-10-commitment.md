<p>Mark Esser was Rare Book Conservator in the <em>John J. Burns Library of Rare Books and Special Collections</em> at Boston College from 1994 until 2008. Mark was greatly admired at   Boston College for the finely crafted bindings he created. This exhibit,   designed to introduce Boston College students to bookbinding and book   conservation, mentions the training Mark received, shows his background   as a teacher at North Bennet Street School, and showcases some of the   conservation bindings that he produced while at Boston College.   Materials and tools used by Mark to make the bookbindings are displayed   along with the books.</p>
