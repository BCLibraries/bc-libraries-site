<p>The Everyman's Library (EML) was first conceived in 1905 by the   publisher Joseph Malaby Dent and editor Ernest Rhys. The goal of EML was   to create a collection of 1,000 volumes of classic literature that   would appeal to every type of person, from students, scholars and   professionals to the everyday working man. They would be divided into   different categories, originally thirteen in total and have   corresponding design attributes. The key to this endeavor was to make   the books affordable, and they were originally available for the very   low price of one schilling. The name &quot;Everyman&quot; comes from the medieval   play of the same name in which the character Knowledge says the   following to the character Everyman:</p>
<p><em>Everyman, I will go with thee</em><br />
  <em>and be thy guide,</em></p>
<p><em>In thy most need to go</em></p>
<p><em>by thy side.</em></p>
<p>The library began publication in February 1906 and four years later   500 volumes had already been published. Through two world wars and a   depression, the series finally published volume 1,000 in 1956. In 1988   the publishing company J.M. Dent was sold and eventually the Everyman   series was re-launched in the early 1990s. Though very different from   the early editions of 1906, you can still buy Everyman's Library books   through Alfred A. Knopf in the United States and Random House abroad.</p>
<p>This exhibit has two purposes firstly, to show the changing styles of   EML throughout the many decades it was in print, and secondly to show   the variety of collections at the Burns Library that contain volumes of   the series. From the Irish collection to the Liturgy and Life   Collection, the personal libraries of authors Rex Stout and Flann   O'Brien, copies of the EML can be found in all of the major collections   in the Burns Library.</p>
