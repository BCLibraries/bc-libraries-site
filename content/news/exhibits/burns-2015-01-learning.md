<em>Early Printed Books: History and Practice</em>, was taught by   Professor Virginia Reinburg, in conjunction with Burns Library   Conservator Barbara Adams Hebard, in the fall of 2014. In this small   class, students had the opportunity to explore the vast changes that the   invention of the printing press brought to Europe around the seminar   table with Professor Reinburg. In the conservator's lab, under the   guidance of Ms. Hebard, students had the opportunity to work on projects   that helped them understand the physicality of the books in the Burns.   Starting with simple techniques and tools, like folding paper to make   puzzle purses, the students progressed to more complicated techniques,   like sewing and blind tooling, making impressions on leather with hot   brass tools. On display are examples of the crafts the students   produced: a puzzle purse, the first project in the lab, a paste paper   pamphlet, a girdle book, and blind-tooled leather plaquettes. Everyone   in the class was able to let their creativity loose on each project, and   no two finished pieces looked alike. Marie Pellissier '15, curator
