<p><em>Scéal a tharraingíonn scéal</em>.  Just as the Burns Library's   iconic Ford Tower evokes the tower of Ballylee Castle, which Irish poet   W. B. Yeats purchased, restored, and celebrated in the popular anthology   of his verse depicted in our exhibit poster, so does one story draw   another, as the Irish proverb goes.  As staff in the Burns Library, we   frequently find ourselves exploring connections behind our rare book and   manuscript collections in just this way.  When we pull at their   narrative threads, we often discover a web of related materials.    Following the stories we uncover leads us on to more stories.  When we   share these stories with our researchers, they in turn share their   discoveries with us.  One story draws another. </p>
<p>There are many such stories in the Irish collections, which are the   most frequently consulted materials in the Burns Library.  Whether a   book, a manuscript, a broadside, a letter, or a musical instrument, each   component of the Irish collections offers an opportunity to learn more   about the history, literature, and culture of Ireland and Irish America.</p>
<p>The exhibit is divided into four sections:  Irish American Fine Press   Books, Irish Traditional Music, Irish-American History in Boston, and   Irish Literature.  Beginning in March, the exhibit will also feature a   fifth section highlighting published scholarship that utilizes research   materials from the Burns Library's Irish collections.</p>
