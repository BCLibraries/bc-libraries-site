<p><em>&quot;In the name of Annah the Allmaziful, the Everliving, the Bringer of Plurabilities, haloed be her eve, her singtime sung, her rill be run,   unhemmed as it is uneven!&quot;</em> (From <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, I.5.104)</p>
<p>Born in Dublin though seemingly fated never to return, Irish novelist   and poet James Joyce (1882 - 1941) attempted to transpose the common   life of his native city onto a heroic scale through a series of   progressively experimental novels. Frequently autobiographical in   content yet mythological in substance, they enthralled readers in   Joyce's personal odyssey while exasperating publishers and provoking   censorship.</p>
<p>This exhibition focuses on the publication of three of Joyce's masterworks: his early short story collection, <em>Dubliners</em>, his epic <em>Ulysses</em>, and his enigmatic <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. It also highlights Boston College's sustained engagement with Joyce through professor Joe Nugent's &quot;Raidin the Wake&quot; <a href="http://bcm.bc.edu/issues/fall_2006/linden_lane/raidin-the-wake.html">reading group</a> and student-curated digital projects, including the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/joyceways/id534524278?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><em>JoyceWays</em> app</a>, <a href="http://digitaldubliners.com/"><em>Digital Dubliners</em> iBook</a>, and the newly launched <em><a href="http://104.236.79.205/">Dubliners Bookshelf</a></em> website.</p>
