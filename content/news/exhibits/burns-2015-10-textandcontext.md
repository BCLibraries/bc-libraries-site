Although they are rarely considered in relation to each other, Nathaniel Hawthorne's <em>The Blithedale Romance</em> (1852) and Frederick Douglass' &quot;The Heroic Slave&quot; (1853) were released   about six months apart by publishers located on the same block in   downtown Boston. Beyond this, both works were richly interwoven into the   fabric of American social, economic, political, literary, and cultural   life. This exhibition, which began in a spring 2015 advanced topic   English seminar, uses rare books, first editions, and periodicals from   the Burns Library's Boston Collection to explore several of these   contexts. Fiction and nonfiction by Douglass and Hawthorne appear with   work by such writers as Louisa May Alcott, T. S. Arthur, Lydia Maria   Child, W. E. B. Du Bois, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Olaudah Equiano, Margaret   Fuller, Harriet Jacobs, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Elizabeth Palmer   Peabody, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry David Thoreau, David Walker,   Booker T. Washington and Phillis Wheatley.
