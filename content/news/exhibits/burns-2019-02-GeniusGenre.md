Flann the novelist. Myles the columnist. Brother Barnabas the student. Brian O’Nolan (1911-1966) wrote in many genres under many guises, in both English and Irish, confounding contemporaries with his incomparable genius and satirical wit.

Using original manuscripts, letters, books, and artifacts from Burns Library’s unrivaled collection of O’Nolan’s papers and personal library, this exhibit unmasks the most enigmatic and elusive literary figure to emerge from 20th-century Ireland next to James Joyce.

The exhibit also features new and original works by Irish artists David and Eddie O’Kane, who have been creating and exhibiting Flann-inspired drawings, paintings, and animated &amp; live-action videos for International Flann O’Brien Society conferences and other venues.
