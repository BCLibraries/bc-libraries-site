<p><em>Interconnected Dimensions </em>is one exhibit in a   series celebrating the Boston College Sesquicentennial. It illustrates   the three aspects of student formation – intellectual, social, and   spiritual – with photographs and printed materials from the University   Archives and monographs from the O&rsquo;Neill and Burns Libraries. The text   is exclusively from the booklet, <em>Journey to Adulthood</em> (Boston   College, 2007), available through the Office of Mission and Ministry.   Images of students engaged in service activities come from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bostoncollege/">Boston College Flickr site</a>.<br>
