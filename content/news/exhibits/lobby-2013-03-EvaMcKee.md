<p>Born in Belfast, Ireland in 1890, <a target="_blank" href="http://hdl.handle.net/2345/1130">McKee</a> was among the artists who championed the Celtic revival of Irish arts   and crafts during the 1920s and 1930s. McKee and fellow artisan and   business partner, Eveline McCloy, are credited with making Belfast the   foremost center of craftwork in the Celtic or Irish style in the 1920s.</p>
<p>The exhibit includes graphic items, texts, and decorative items,   including a hand painted image of an  Irish cottage and landscape with   text of a poem by W.M. Letts, a card with black pen-and-ink Celtic   design and the text of Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Breastplate prayer, a card with   black pen-and-ink Celtic design with the text <em>Athas ar do theach</em> which translates from the Irish as &ldquo;Happiness upon your house,&rdquo; a silver   pin with Celtic design and blue enamel bead and a small copper plate   with Celtic design.  All items are from the <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2345/1130">Eva McKee collection</a> at the Burns Library.</p>
