<p>By 1929, when Boston College established its first professional   school, the institution was already 65 years old. At this time the   Chestnut Hill campus consisted of only four buildings – the Recitation   Building (Gasson Hall), St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall, the Science Building (Devlin   Hall), and the Library (Bapst Library) – and overlooked twin reservoirs.   The <a href="http://archive.org/stream/bostoncollegecat1928bost#page/n7/mode/2up">1928 Boston College directory</a> listed only a College of Arts and Sciences, a Graduate School, and   affiliated schools for training members of the Society of Jesus at West   Stockbridge and Weston. The next year marked a change with the addition   of the <a href="http://archive.org/stream/bostoncollegebul1929bost#page/158/mode/2up/">Law School</a>. Once the Law School was established (1929), other professional schools followed: <a href="http://archive.org/stream/bostoncollegebul3637bost#page/n141/mode/2up/">School of Social Work (1936)</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/stream/bostoncollegesc3839bost#page/n5/mode/2up">School of Business Administration (1938)</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/stream/bostoncollegebusc4748bost#page/n3/mode/2up">School of Nursing (1947)</a>, and, finally, the <a href="http://archive.org/stream/bostoncollegebul1951bost#page/n1/mode/2up">School of Education (1952)</a>.   With the exception of the School of Education, which introduced   coeducation on the Chestnut Hill campus, these Boston College programs   all had their start in downtown Boston. The Boston College Law School,   Graduate School of Social Work, Carroll School of Management, Connell   School of Nursing, and Lynch School of Education, as they are now known,   are all well-established and well-regarded; this exhibit highlights   their beginnings.</p>
