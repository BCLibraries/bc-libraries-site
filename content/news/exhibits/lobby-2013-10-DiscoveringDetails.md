<p>2013 is Boston College&rsquo;s sesquicentennial anniversary as an   institution and centennial on the Chestnut Hill campus. This exhibit,   which presents lesser-known aspects of Boston College history, was   prepared in collaboration with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/history/faculty/alphabetical/otoole_james.html">James O&rsquo;Toole</a>,   Boston College Professor and Clough Millennium Chair in History. Dr.   O&rsquo;Toole, who is writing a history of Boston College, recently presented a   talk to alumni entitled &ldquo;10 Things You Don&rsquo;t Know about Boston College   History&rdquo;; the exhibit is drawn from his talk and illustrated by material   from the Boston College University Archives held by the John J. Burns   Library.</p>
