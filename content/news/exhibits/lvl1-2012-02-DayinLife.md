A Day in the Life at BC is a photography exhibition displaying a great variety of activities occurring on the Boston College campus throughout a single day, January 31st, 2012. This collaborative project was open to all in the BC community with a photograph to share. The exhibition chronicles 24 hours of a typical day in the life of a BC student and documents the many ways in which life on campus unfolds.
