College&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Literature and Arts Journal: &ldquo;The Best of<em>The Laughing Medusa</em>&rdquo;. After a ten-year hiatus, <em>The Laughing Medusa</em> reappeared   on The Heights in the spring of 2006 and publishes annually. The name   for the publication comes from an essay by the French feminist Hélène   Cixous. Cixous famously transformed the traditional image of the   mythical medusa monster into a figure of beauty. She wrote, &ldquo;You only   have to look at the Medusa straight on to see her. And she&rsquo;s not deadly,   she&rsquo;s beautiful and she&rsquo;s laughing&rdquo;. <em>The Laughing Medusa</em> looks   to celebrate the beautiful and diverse voices of the women on BC&rsquo;s   campus. This exhibit highlights some of the visual and written works   from 2006-2011.
