Emerging out of a need to advertise the Theatre Department&rsquo;s production: <em>Rising UP: A Dance Showcase</em>, and celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Robsham Theater Arts Center, came the idea of photographing Boston College student dancers in locations all around campus.  Inspired by <em>The Ballerina Project</em> in New York City, the marketing campaign promotes the idea of dance as part of the fabric of our lives.  The photography by Marc Franklin &rsquo;12 and Nate Richardson &rsquo;13 captures ordinary people in conventional places.  Yet, these flashes of brilliance gently mix the beauty of art with the common flow of everyday life at Boston College. What makes the project special is how personal it is.  The places are familiar and the people even more familiar. The Rising UP Project represents a larger culture at BC comprised of artists of all kinds. It makes evident that art is everywhere, and how a simple promotion idea can evolve and flourish into a creative and advanced photographic exploration!
