<em>Kaleidoscope International Journal</em> intends to serve as an   unbiased medium for students to publish research and opinions on   international affairs, share personal experiences from around the globe   with the Boston College community, and generally promote a global   outlook at Boston College. A major part of the journal is the   photo-diary, each of which serves as a window into the photographer's   experiences in a foreign country.
