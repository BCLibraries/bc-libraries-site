EcoPledge&rsquo;s <em>The Life Cycle of a Water Bottle</em> exhibit depicts the extensive amount of natural resources required to create a single water bottle. The exhibit also demonstrates the environmental impact of recycling in comparison to disposing of a water bottle in a landfill. Ultimately, the goal of the project is to show how a seemingly innocent everyday item can have huge environmental consequences, and further emphasize how easy it is to seek sustainable alternatives.
