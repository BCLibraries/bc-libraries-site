<p>"This exhibition grew out of an assignment I came up with for   students in my Art &amp; Digital Technology classes. Its source is one   of my own photographic endeavors; <em>Every Day</em>.<br>
</p>
<p><em>Every Day</em> is a project in which, starting on February 23,   1987, I began taking one more or less identically posed and lighted   photograph of my face every day. I have maintained this practice up to   and through the present, and plan to continue each day for the remainder   of my life. More about Every Day may be found at <a href="http://kbeveryday.blogspot.com">http://kbeveryday.blogspot.com</a></p>
<p>About 10 years ago, I began to give my Art &amp; Digital Technology   classes a new assignment; I&rsquo;d send each student a digital photo of my   face, from the <em>Every Day</em> project, for them to play with in Adobe   Photoshop, to transform as they saw fit. My intention was to give them   something of mine, and have them apply their creative resources and   budding Photoshop skills to make it their own.<br>
</p>
<p>By 2008, I had been working on my own project long enough to be able   to individualize the image I'd send to each student; I could now give   some, then many, then all of them the photo I'd taken of my face on the   day they were born. This new aspect added a more specific collaborative   aspect to the assignment, a condition I suggested that they try to bring   to their finished piece. The question posed was, 'How can you alter   this image so that it visually and conceptually has something to do with   the day you were born? Something about your family, perhaps, or the   place where you lived. What happened in the world on that date?' "Â  -   Prof. Karl Baden, Fine Arts Dept.</p>
