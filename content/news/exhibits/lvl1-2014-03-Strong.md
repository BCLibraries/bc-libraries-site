<p><em>"I Am Strong" Strong Women, Strong Girls at Boston College</em> <br>
"The purpose of this exhibit is to bring awareness to the BC chapter of   Strong Women, Strong Girls, as well as to portray what it means to be   women in society today. We all come from different backgrounds and   circumstances, which make us all individually unique. However, as   females we all share a bond that only we can understand. We are strong   and proud to be who we are, and we should never be afraid to show it.   This exhibit is based on an article that was written in <em><a href="http://www.bcheights.com/news/report-confirms-decline-of-female-self-esteem-at-bc-1.3128620?pagereq=1#.UwzY3uNdWSo">The Heights</a></em>,   the independent student newspaper at Boston College. The article talks   about a study that was done in 2012, revealing that female Boston   College students' self-confidence declines during their four years at   BC. The study sheds light upon a very important issue on campus,   concluding with recommendations on how the University can try and   reverse the ongoing issue."  -- <em>Abigail Blaisdell, College of Advancing Studies '15, BC Chapter of Strong Women, Strong Girls</em></p>
