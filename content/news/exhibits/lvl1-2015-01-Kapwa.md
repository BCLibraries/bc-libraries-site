<p><strong><em>Discovering Kapwa</em> </strong><em>Encountering community, love, and hope in the Philippines. </em>In the Philippines, the term <em>kapwa</em> implies a shared identity of solidarity: the idea that I am not me without you. <em>Kapwa</em> is a pervasive ideal through the Philippines, and is seen in everyday   encounters, such as inviting strangers into one&rsquo;s home to sing karaoke,   offering food to another in need, or just the invitation to play from a   child. </p>
