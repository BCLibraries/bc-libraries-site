<p>The purpose of this exhibit is to share the richness of the Middle   East and North African (MENA) culture with the Boston College   community.  These photographs taken by Boston College students   illustrate the diversity of peoples, geographies, religions,   architecture, and foods from many of the countries that stretch the   region.  This exhibit, showcased in the Level One Gallery of O&rsquo;Neill   Library for the month of March, celebrates this cultural pluralism.  We   believe that a glance into many cultures is the first step towards   breaking down stereotypes of the region often portrayed by Western   media. Instead, we hope to replace these negative images with a lively   and dynamic depiction of the MENA region.  From Fez, Morocco to Dubai,   United Arab Emirates (UAE) the Middle East is home to some of the most   cosmopolitan cities and stunning environmental phenomenon in the world.</p>
<p>Both the Arab Students Association and the Middle East and Islamic   Societies Students Association encourage students, faculty, and staff to   continue to explore the rich culture of the Middle East and North   Africa with us during <em>MENA Heritage Week</em> from April 13-18, 2015.</p>
