  <p><strong><em>Embodied Stories: Lived Experiences of Boston College Students</em></strong>.    "We are human.  We all bear our own burdens.  We do not, however, need   to bear them alone.  These intimate portraits are an attempt to convey   the idea that although we might differ from one another in certain ways,   we are all connected through our lived experiences---which, for better   or for worse, have shaped us into the people we are today.  Scars might   be a sign of something we've escaped and triumphed over; tattoos we   elect to have mark us, indelibly sharing something internal, externally;   our body shape and the color of our skin might participate in the pride   of a culture.  By nature of living as embodied humans, we collect and   grow into these marks---these identifiers---that reinforce both our   individuality and our sameness.  In the spirit of<em>Love Your Body Week</em> and   the Women's Center's mission, it is my hope that these portraits   enkindle a sense of self-acceptance and community in viewers and that   they act as something of a mirror, permitting us all to reflect on our   own insecurities---and how the might be celebrated." <br>
