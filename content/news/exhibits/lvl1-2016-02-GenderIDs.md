<p>"I am a Mexican-American artist who is creating what he believes will   spark conversations around the topics of gender identities and   expressions in the Black community. I am an advocate of equality,   regardless of race, gender identity, socioeconomic status, and religious   affiliation. </p>
<p>My goal with this exhibit is to create pieces that will focus on the   beauty that is being a Black man or a Black woman while also breaking   down the ideologies surrounding gender identities such as   hyper-sexuality, patriarchy, hyper masculinity and homophobia. Some of   my pieces will be self-explanatory while others will invite the viewer   to internally breakdown what they believe the piece means in their own   words. I hope to ignite some emotions which hopefully encourages the   viewer to examine their own ideologies of this topic. My pieces will   focus on the joy and pain that is gender identity and expression."  <em>-- Frank Garcia-Ornelas, GSSW, '16</em></p>
