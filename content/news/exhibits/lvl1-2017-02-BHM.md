My work is an examination of the different forms black identity takes outside this socially constructed spectrum. I use natural concepts and human interaction to express the variety black people provide. Altering them is a way of questioning the attitudes, fears and unwritten rules that form the environment and our behavior within it. Celebrate the human, the marks people make on the world. Treasuring the local, the small-scale, the eccentric, and the ordinary.  â€“ <em>Jordan Barros, MCAS, '19</em>
