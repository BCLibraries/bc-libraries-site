The Boston College Dance Ensemble is a student-run organization that provides opportunities for approximately thirty talented dancers to choreograph and perform. All the proceeds that BCDE generates from performances benefit the Boston College Campus School, a non-profit special education day school for students ages 3-21 with multiple disabilities. BCDE members are proud to share their passion for dance with those in and outside the Boston College community through bi-annual productions at the Robsham Theater and at other events around campus. 

Come see Dance Ensemble perform "Majesty" in Robsham on March 16th and 17th at 7 PM at the Robsham Theater!
