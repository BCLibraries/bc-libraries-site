<p><em>Reflections through Time </em>is presented by the Boston College   Women's Resource Center and Boston College Libraries to showcase the   past and present accomplishments of recent alumnae and current female   students of Boston College. As Boston College celebrates its   Sesquicentennial, the exhibit aims to highlight the various ways in   which women have contributed to the growth of the university and the   fulfillment of its Jesuit mission.</p>
<p>The exhibit features four prominent alumnae who have established   themselves in various professional fields and illustrates how their work   at BC inspired them in those pursuits. The exhibit also highlights six   current students who enrich the university in a multitude of ways. The   exhibit seeks to increase the visibility of women in the history of   Boston College. The final exhibit element is a mirror which acts as an   impetus to encourage current students to reflect on their potential, to   examine their current involvements, and to harness their power to   achieve success in their post-graduate pursuits.</p>
