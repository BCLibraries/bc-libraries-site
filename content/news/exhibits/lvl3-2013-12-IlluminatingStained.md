The stained glass windows in the Bapst and Burns Libraries were designed by Earl Edward Sanborn in the 1920s.  The windows illustrate the various disciplines taught at Boston College; the shields of the 54 Jesuit institutions around the world; the genesis of the book; characters from Chaucer and Shakespeare; Jesuit missionaries and martyrs in the New World;  as well as literary figures, historians, orators, poets, essayists, novelists, and statesmen.  This exhibit features just a small selection of these windows.  A visit to these libraries is truly the best way to appreciate the richness of the vivid colors and artistic style.
