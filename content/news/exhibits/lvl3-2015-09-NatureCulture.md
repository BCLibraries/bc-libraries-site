 <p>Peripatetic by nature, I have linked my work as an   artist to my travels.  Travel, as a source of visual imagery and   inspiration has long been a part of both the European and American   painting traditions.  For me, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia   occupy a special place in my heart and in my mind's eye.  The natural   and cultural landscapes of these places are formidable sources for my   work.</p>
  <p>The works in this exhibition investigate the relation between nature   and culture.  I am fascinated by the ways in which different cultures   present idealized versions of the natural and social worlds.  This   recent series of prints reference images from Art Deco, Japanese <em>ukiyo-e</em> prints and medieval heraldry. These approaches use bold, flat design,   crisp, fluid drawing and strong color, and produce powerful images   concerned with idealized beauty and are saturated with social politics.</p>
  <p>I reference these works to explore the complex relationship between   nature and culture, the meeting of Eastern and Western ideals and above   all my own ideas of visual power and beauty.</p>
  <p>I have been involved with digital printmaking for the last decade.    These prints stand on their own as completed works.  They often precede   my paintings and indeed serve as a sketchbook for the larger works.                                        </p>
