<em><strong>24 Hour News  </strong></em>These paintings were made as meditations on   war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow,   inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to   beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events   in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of   manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in   our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of   Paintings that comprise <em>24 Hour News</em> grew out of those   disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously   absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face   of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, &quot;stuff   happens&quot;, I knew we were doomed to endure the &quot;farce of arrogance&quot; in   its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat   unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the   paintings <em>What's So Funny?</em>.  The images of the tortured and   humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack   of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the   victims.  <em>Spine</em>  and <em>Half a Brain</em> express that vulnerability. The <em>Lap</em> paintings   were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the   picture. The Virgin Mary's Lap, which normally holds such love and   tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With <em>Launch</em> the Virgin's lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below.
