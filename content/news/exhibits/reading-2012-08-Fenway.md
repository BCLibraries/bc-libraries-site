Fenway Park was built in 1912, and Boston College moved to Chestnut Hill in 1913. With no site to accommodate large crowds, the Eagles played their football games in Fenway Park. Recently they have played hockey as part of the "Frozen Fenway" program. This exhibit uses items from the BC Archives and materials on loan from the Red Sox to celebrate a century of cooperation.
