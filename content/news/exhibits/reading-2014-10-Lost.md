The pieces in this exhibit are puzzle purses, made by students and professors in the class <em>Early Printed Books: History and Craft, </em>taught   by Professor Virginia Reinburg in conjunction with the staff at the   Burns Library, particularly conservator Barbara Hebard. This class   focuses on the revolution in ideas, culture, and technology spurred by   Johan Gutenberg&rsquo;s invention of the printing press around 1450, through   reading and hands-on practice. The puzzle purses, which are made by   folding paper into a purse shape, were our first foray into the world of   book-making. In this project, we learned about the different qualities   of paper, and were introduced to the tools of the bookbinder,   specifically the bone folder. The puzzle purses here were inspired by a   variety of sources, including the books in the Burns Library   collections, personal experiences, and Boston itself.
