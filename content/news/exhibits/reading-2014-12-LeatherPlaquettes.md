<p>The members of Professor Virginia Reinburg's class, <em>Early Printed Books: History and Craft</em>,   produced the designs ornamenting each of the leather plaquettes   featured in this exhibit. The course, taught at the Burns Library and in   collaboration with the staff there, principally the conservator Barbara   Adams Hebard, explores the print culture that developed in early modern   Europe in the centuries immediately following Johannes Gutenberg's   famed invention. Of course, the class also focuses on the craft of   bookbinding as it existed in those same centuries. </p>
<p>Blind tooling, the technique demonstrated here, is part of the   finishing process, whereby the bookbinder impresses on the leather a   design and perhaps the title of the volume bound. This is done by   heating the specialized instruments also exhibited here and stamping   them, with some force, onto the leather surface. The tools were, and   still are, expensive, so often bookbinders possess only a few, which   they use rather imaginatively to create a variety of patterns. Early   bookbinders, however, did not typically approach the task with a concern   for precision or a desire for perfection. Hence, some of the more   exacting designs on display are more reminiscent of the   nineteenth-century blind tooling techniques employed by bookbinders like   T. J. Cobden-Sanderson, who was influenced by the accuracy of new   machine-made designs, products of the industrial revolution. </p>
