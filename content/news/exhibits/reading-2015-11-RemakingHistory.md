The students of Professor Virginia Reinburg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Early Printed Books&rdquo;   class have a display of their handiwork in the O&rsquo;Neill Library.<br>
<br>
One thing that set the course apart from many of the other offerings of   the BC history department was that it required the use of the students&rsquo;   hands. They studied the material aspects of books alongside their   content, and, under the guidance of the Burns Library&rsquo;s conservator   Barbara Adams Hebard, designed and constructed several books themselves.   The chance to use the sort of tools printers and bookbinders have used   in their workshops for hundreds of years brought the students into the   material past in a way no written words ever could have done.<br>
 <br>
The sheets of vellum and paste paper they cut, folded, and sewed to make   covers for their books were especially evocative to work with: these   materials are ubiquitous in the Burns Library&rsquo;s holdings from the 16th   through the 18th centuries.<br>
<br>
Using a cloth that shares many properties with velvet, they sewed   chemises for copies of the Boston College publication "What are we?" in   imitation of the "girdle books" of prayers that wealthy, pious men and   women of the late medieval period sometimes wore at their sides. These   are on display, too.<br>
<br>
The students also had the opportunity to do tooling on leather   plaquettes with heated brass stamps. This is a technique that many   bookbinders have employed to print titles and decorations on books with   covers are made from leather.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the exhibit! The real treat was the process of building these   books, but the curators hope you can learn something from looking at the   end results.<br>
