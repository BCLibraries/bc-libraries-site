The Easter Rising marked a turning point in Irish history that would bring an end to centuries of colonial rule. The Rising was not just a product of menâ€™s struggles for independence and freedom: Irish women, too, were instrumental in the rebellion. This exhibit focuses on the lives and contributions of three of those women: Contstance Markievicz, Maude Gonne, and Mollie Gill.
