This spring, the students in the History Department's Making History Public course, with the help of Boston College librarians, have mounted an exhibit illustrating the ways in which comic books reflected American history. The exhibit, entitled "Revealing America’s History Through Comics," shows how Captain America grappled with the disillusionment of Watergate, Superman buffed up during the fitness craze of the 1970s, and Batwoman combatted sexism. The exhibit draws on the Edward J. Kane comic book collection at the Burns Library, a collection of more than 11,000 items to examine how comic books reflected events from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to the collapse of the Twin Towers on 9/11. "Revealing America's History Through Comics" will hang on the third floor of Stokes Hall from February until August 2014.
