In the spring of 2015, Professor Seth Meehan's 14 undergraduate students of the History Department's course "Making History Public: Boston College" revisited their institutionâ€™s history, soon after the 150th anniversary of its founding. A result of their research is this exhibit, which, inspired by their predecessors in 1913, uses the page design of an early yearbook.
