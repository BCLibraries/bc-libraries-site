The curators would like to express eternal gratitude to the following people at Boston College, whose work, expertise, and/or financial support have been critical to this exhibition.  From O’Neill Library: Chelcie Juliet Rowell & Tom Wall.  From the B.C. History Department: Christine Bertoglio,  Kevin Kenny, Colleen O’Reilly, Sarah Ross & Carolyn Twomey. From the University Administration: Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences Dean Gregory Kalscheur & Provost David Quigley. Special thanks to Hero of Labor Andrea Wisniewski, both a student curator and Research Assistant, whose work during the summer was crucial for the putting together of this show; Kevin Tringale (O’Neill Library), who worked so hard to keep us visual; Chris Houston-Ponchak (O’Neill Library) for his hard work on designing and producing our exhibit & Chris Soldt (Media Technology Services), whose extraordinary photographs of the finds recovered from our three latrines are so crucial to the stories we tell.  Last, but certainly not least, we are happy to acknowledge City of Boston Archaeologist  Joseph Bagley, without whose collection, expertise, enthusiasm, and generosity none of this would have been possible.  And in memory of the people of #2 Unity Court, the Paul Revere House & Dorchester’s Industrial School for Girls, whose garbage has so occupied and beguiled us.
