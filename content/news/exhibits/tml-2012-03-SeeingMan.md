This exhibition, featuring artwork created by men imprisoned in American jails and penitentiaries, is a joint effort between the Boston College School of Theology and Ministry Prison Ministry Initiative, Faith and Justice Committee, and Do-Right Ministries, a non-profit organization that raises awareness about the American justice system and promotes healing through art.

Presented during Lent, a Christian penitential season that encourages reflection on social justice issues such as the American prison system, the exhibit is co-sponsored by the School of Theology and Ministry Student Forum, the  School of Theology and Ministry, the Boston College University Libraries, and the Episcopal Chaplaincy at Boston College.
