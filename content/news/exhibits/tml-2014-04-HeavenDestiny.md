  <p>This exhibit, drawn from the rich resources of the John J. Burns Library Liturgy and Life   collection, seeks to introduce younger Catholics and others to a world   of religious piety and worship now lost, or at least less familiar than   the one that has defined the U.S. Catholic community of the past half   century.<br>
  </p>
  <p>"[The] Catholicism that shaped the lives and memories of millions of   children in the 1940s and 1950s was first experienced as a 'vast set of   intermeshed habits' (Garry Wills, Bare Ruined Choirs: Doubt, Prophecy, and Radical Religion)   that was the American Catholic world of religion…. Indeed, this   American Catholic world was a 'total experience' (Wills) not unlike   being Amish in Pennsylvania or Mormon in Utah, but stretching coast to   coast..."</p>
  <p>      --Mark Stephen Massa, The American Catholic Revolution: How the Sixties Changed the Church Forever</p>
  <p>The objects and images chosen for inclusion in the exhibit all   witness - in different ways - to that pre-Vatican II sense of U.S.   Catholicism that "we grew up different" (Wills) from other Americans in   part because almost all U.S. Catholics believed that - even as compared   with other Christians - heaven was their destiny in a privileged sense.</p>
