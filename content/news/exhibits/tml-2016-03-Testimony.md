<p><em>"The most powerful human forces are found in the meeting of the face and gaze. Only there do we exist for one another."</em>  –Karl Ove Knausgaard</p>
<p>Photographer Lisa Fitzgerald lived and worked as a Religious of the   Sacred Heart in Jalapa, Nicaragua from 1980 -1984 at the time of the   Contra War. During those years, she took photographs of many of the   people she made friends with there, almost all of whom worked in the   tobacco fields. Throughout the intervening years on repeated visits, she   has re-photographed several of these same people, capturing their   beauty, dignity and resolve while also powerfully chronicling the   physical toll of strenuous labor, exposure to pesticides, and the   after-effects of war on their lives and circumstances.</p>
