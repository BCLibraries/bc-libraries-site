Japan’s foremost Christian artist, Sadao Watanabe (1913-1996) converted from Buddhism to Christianity at 17 years old. He soon combined his new faith with an interest in preserving the traditional Japanese folk art of stencil dying, or <em>katazome</em>, by creating colorful representation of biblical scenes that he hoped would speak to his people. He said, ‘My task is to stand within the artistic tradition of Japan…Theology will not take deep root in Japanese soil if it is merely an import.” Each hand cut print has been created using a complicated traditional stencil art form used for dying kimonos. 

His prints are part of many international collections including the Vatican Museum, National Galleries in Washington, DC and London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo.  

Watanabe’s chief desire was to create art that could be enjoyed by common people and displayed in ordinary settings. <em>Witness to Faith</em> hopes to help fulfill his wishes by offering over 30 of his original <em>momigami</em> (wrinkled paper) and <em>washi</em> (Japanese paper) prints, calendars that have been printed since the early 1970s, and stencil Christmas cards he made for friends.
