<em>The Holy City: Art of Love, Unity & Resurrection</em> presents an historic exhibition of original works by the Passages Artists Collective.  Scheduled to coincide with African-American History Month and the <a href="http://www.agnt.org/season-for-nonviolence" target="_blank">Season of Non Violence</a>, this exhibit features a selection of quilts included in a multi-media exhibit that opened in May of 2016 in Charleston, South Carolina.  

Born of the raw emotions following the 2015 mass shooting of nine people attending a Bible study session at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, this exhibit pays tribute to the victims with art that encourages healing, provokes thoughtful discourse, promotes peace, and reveals community.  The Holy City exhibit gives voice to the breadth and depth of the Black-American experience.

The Passages Artists Collective is a group of fine artists working in diverse media to tell the stories of the global African diaspora.  The works, sometimes mournful, sometimes celebratory, sometimes defiant and often hopeful, provoke the viewer to deep thought and spiritual awakening about our shared history and humanity.
