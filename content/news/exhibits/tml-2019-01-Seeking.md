<strong>Exhibit launch and opening reception:</strong><br/> February 4th, 2019, 4:00pm - 6:00pm (<em>snow date February 6th</em>)

Jesuit Father Daniel Berrigan and theologian and civil rights lawyer William Stringfellow belonged to an old American tradition -- faith-based activism.  During the tumultous 1960s and long afterward, the two friends, both hard-working, prolific authors, were also activist opponents of the war in Vietnam and campaigners for civil rights, social justice in the Christian tradition, nucelar disarmament, and the environment.

<em>Seeking Shelter: A Story of Place, Faith and Resistance</em>, the multi-media exhibition that tells this intriguing, moving, and timely story, made its debut on Block Island at the Island Free Library in July of 2017.  The accompanying film, <em>Seeking Shelter</em>, illuminates the exhibition's themes through the recollections of people who knew the story's central figures well and have deep insight into Block Island as a place and as a community.

All are welcome at the opening reception on Monday, February 4th, 2019 (snow date, Wednesday, February 6th) from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. at the Atrium Gallery of Boston College's Theology and Ministry Library.  The reception will feature a shared keynote address by <strong>Mark S. Massa, S.J.</strong>, and <strong>Gardiner Shattuck</strong>, who will comment on the Berrigans and William Stringfellow respectively. There will also be a screening of the <em>Seeking Shelter</em> film and talk-back with film director,<strong>Sue Hagedorn</strong>. 

The exhibition will remain in the Atrium Gallery through April 12th. For directions and parking information, please see the <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/tml/visit">Visit page on the website</a> for the Theology and Ministry Library.
