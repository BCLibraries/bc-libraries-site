This critical edition of <em>Daniel</em>, one of the earliest post-classical Arthurian romances, includes the normalized Middle High German text with an introduction, selected bibliography, index of proper names, and a reproduction of the first verse of the original manuscript. In addition to the textual-critical apparatus, the third edition includes a second apparatus with linguistic explanations intended to ease access to the text.
