<p>Across the world, requirements for becoming a teacher have become  increasingly stringent and more technology is making its way into curricula and  instruction. The <em>TIMSS 2015 Encyclopedia:  Education Policy and Curriculum in Mathematics and Science</em> draws on data  from TIMSS 2015, an education assessment of 60 countries and regions at the  fourth and eighth grades directed by Drs. Ina V.S. Mullis and Michael O.  Martin. No other publication offers such a comprehensive look at global  education: each participating country or region authored a chapter describing  its educational system, and students and their parents, teachers, and  principals completed questionnaires about the contexts of their learning and  teaching. The encyclopedia shows that countries allocate significant  instructional time for mathematics and science, national curricular guidelines  in those subjects are emerging in preprimary programs, and school systems are  investing in digital devices ranging from basic tools to sophisticated systems. </p>
<p>The <em>TIMSS 2015 Encyclopedia</em> is a companion to the <em>TIMSS 2015  International Results in Mathematics and Science</em>. TIMSS (Trends in  International Mathematics and Science Study) spans 20 years of trends, the  longest of any international education assessment. </p>
