This book offers a concise and up-to-date review of the essential analysis and action underlying scholarly engagement with the world of business. It discusses the sorts of capabilities academics need to collaborate effectively with practitioners and illustrates good practice through international case studies drawn from acknowledged centers of excellence. These show how to negotiate different constituencies with different priorities, values, and practices to work together to produce research of rigor and relevance.
