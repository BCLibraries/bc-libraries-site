Professor Conley talks about his experience of painting lilies in winter, how a flower that blooms in winter reminds us of regeneration and spring, and the symbolic meaning of lilies in Christian iconography. In his own words "The Lily is associated with Easter and Christ's resurrection, representing a new season, a rebirth. The Lily shows up in Christian painting as symbol for Mary and other Saints from Catherine of Siena to St. Joseph whose staff blossomed like a lily". Professor Conley also recalls his time at the Mountain Lake Symposium and Workshop "Art in Locale".
