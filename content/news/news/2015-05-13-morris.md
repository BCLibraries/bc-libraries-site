The John J. Burns Library holds books from the personal library of the eminent nineteenth century Boston lawyer, Robert Morris (1823-1882). The majority of the Morris Library has been housed in the Bostonia Collection, a group of  materials aimed at preserving Boston and Massachusetts history.  I was recently charged with isolating the Morris books from the larger collection in order to survey their physical condition.
