Nicholas Culpeperâ€™s Anatomy of the Body of Man, published in 1653, not only contributed to a great leap forward in medical knowledge but was also positioned at the nexus of religious, political, and scientific upheaval in England. Both Culpeper and his publisher Peter Cole were political and religious activists who were influenced by their radical beliefs to create medical texts in the vernacular.
