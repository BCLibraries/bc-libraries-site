In the final semester of my Boston College career, I have had the good fortune of serving as a Conservation Assistant under Barbara Adams Hebard in the John J. Burns Library of Rare Books and Special Collections conservation lab. As an art history major and lifelong lover of books and libraries, working with rare books is like sending a child into a toy store. Every week, I marvel at and handle priceless objects from Boston Collegeâ€™s outstanding collection of rare materials.
