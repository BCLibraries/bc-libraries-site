Nobel prize-winning Irish writer William Butler Yeats often revised and in some cases rewrote his lyrics. The brief poem above indicates not only a care for sound and quality of lyric, but the evolution of the interior life of his mind and soul. Yeatsâ€™s exploration of religious and spiritual matters drove such progressive transformations.
