Peripatetic by nature, I have linked my work as an artist to my travels.  Travel, as a source of visual imagery and inspiration has long been a part of both the European and American painting traditions.  For me, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia occupy a special place in my heart and in my mindâ€™s eye.  The natural and cultural landscapes of these places are formidable sources for my work.

The works in this exhibition investigate the relation between nature and culture.  I am fascinated by the ways in which different cultures present idealized versions of the natural and social worlds.  This recent series of prints reference images from Art Deco, Japanese ukiyo-e prints and medieval heraldry. These approaches use bold, flat design, crisp, fluid drawing and strong color, and produce powerful images concerned with idealized beauty and are saturated with social politics.

I reference these works to explore the complex relationship between nature and culture, the meeting of Eastern and Western ideals and above all my own ideas of visual power and beauty.

I have been involved with digital printmaking for the last decade.  These prints stand on their own as completed works.  They often precede my paintings and indeed serve as a sketchbook for the larger works.
