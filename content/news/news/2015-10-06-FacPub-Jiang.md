This work provides a unique focus on the re-emergence of liberal arts education in China. This is the first book that explores in depth the development of liberal arts education in China. Through the extensive use of first hand materials relating to the liberal arts and current viewpoints of Chinese scholars and higher education leaders, Jiang concludes that China must implement a good liberal arts education program to form responsible global citizens.
