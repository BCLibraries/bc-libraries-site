<strong>International Open Access Week</strong>, a global event now entering its eighth year, promotes the free, immediate, online access to the results of scholarly research, and the right to use and re-use those results as you need to. Research funding agencies, academic institutions, researchers and scientists, teachers, students, and members of the general public are supporting a move towards Open Access in increasing numbers every year.
