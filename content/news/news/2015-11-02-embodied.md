<em>Embodied Stories: Lived Experiences of Boston College Students</em>.  "We are human.  We all bear our own burdens.  We do not, however, need to bear them alone.  These intimate portraits are an attempt to convey the idea that although we might differ from one another in certain ways, we are all connected through our lived experiences---which, for better or for worse, have shaped us into the people we are today."
