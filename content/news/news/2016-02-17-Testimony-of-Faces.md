Photographer Lisa Fitzgerald lived and worked as a Religious of the Sacred Heart in Jalapa, Nicaragua from 1980 -1984 at the time of the Contra War. During those years, she took photographs of many of the people she made friends with there, almost all of whom worked in the tobacco fields. Throughout the intervening years on repeated visits, she has re-photographed several of these same people, capturing their beauty, dignity and resolve while also powerfully chronicling the physical toll of strenuous labor, exposure to pesticides, and the after-effects of war on their lives and circumstances.
