[**Missionary Linguistics in colonial Africa**](http://corpus-missionnaire.bc.edu) is a student project led by Doyle Calhoun
(Departments of Slavic & Eastern Languages and Literatures, and Romance Languages and
Literatures majoring in Linguistics and French). Calhoun was interested in analyzing a set
of 24, mid-19th to early-20th century, dictionary/grammars compiled by French Catholic
missionaries working in North and Central Africa that are held in the [Nicholas M. Williams
Ethnological Collection](http://www.bc.edu/libraries/collections/collinfo/a-zlist/rarebooks.html) of the John J. Burns Library at Boston College. He completed this
work as an extension of his Senior Honors Thesis. A descriptive article about this project
is available in the [recent issue](http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2016spring/doyle.html) of the Boston College Library Newsletter. This project was
possible due to the collaboration and support provided by [library staff](http://corpus-missionnaire.bc.edu/project-team) and required the
application and implementation of a number of different [digital humanities methods and
technical solutions](http://corpus-missionnaire.bc.edu/praxis), including the creation of a database with descriptive metadata, text
encoding, geospatial visualization, and web design.
