Yom HaShoah is the day that honors the memory of the victims of the Holocaust (1933-1945).  This year Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, is recognized from sundown May 4 to sundown May 5. In the Nazi-era, six million Jews and millions of others -- including homosexuals, gypsies, political and religious dissenters, and the disabled -- were murdered in concentration camps, extermination camps, and mass public executions.  The enormity of this collective human loss remains unfathomable. This exhibit recognizes three Jewish women artists who died in the Auschwitz concentration camp: writer Irène Némirovsky, violinist Alma Rosé, and painter Charlotte Salomon.  Kiev born and French dwelling Irène Némirovsky, best known for the posthumous bestselling novella Suite française, was the author of more than a dozen novels in her lifetime.  Alma Rosé, niece of composer Gustav Mahler, was the founder of a women’s orchestra, The Waltzing Girls of Vienna.  And Berliner Charlotte Salomon created an autobiographical series of 769 paintings while hiding in the south of France known as Life? or Theater? We invite you to explore these women’s lives in Boston College Libraries.
