<h4>You Are Here: The Chestnut Hill Campus in Maps & Photos from the University Archives</h4>

<p>Gargan Hall landing, Bapst Library <br />
May - July, 2016 </p>

<p>YOU ARE HERE in the Bapst Art Library, the fourth Boston College building constructed in Chestnut Hill – a neighborhood that comprises parts of Boston, Brookline, and Newton. In 1926 construction on this building was halted due to lack of funds and the lower floors were temporarily roofed-over so that the library could be used. The fourth floor was soon added, and the building was dedicated at Commencement, 1928.  Boston College President Thomas I. Gasson, SJ (1859-1930) is credited with terming the Chestnut Hill campus "The Heights." Much has changed since Boston College moved to this location from the South End neighborhood of Boston in 1913, but the beauty of the area’s rock ledges and nearby ponds, reservoirs and parks – along with its close proximity to the city – are still the unique characteristics of this site.  These two exhibit cases contain a small sample of images from the Boston College University Archives, which are housed in Bapst as part of the John J. Burns Library. Numerous photographs and publications telling the story of the University from the time of its founding are available digitally. Many others are available for use in the Burns Library Reading Room. You are invited to explore these resources online or in person!  --<em>Shelley Barber, Burns Library</em></p>
