<h4>You Are Here: The Chestnut Hill Campus in Maps & Photos from the University Archives</h4>

<p>Gargan Hall landing, Bapst Library <br />
May - September, 2016 </p>

<p>YOU ARE HERE is an exhibit now on view in the Bapst Library, the fourth Boston College building constructed in Chestnut Hill – a neighborhood that comprises parts of Boston, Brookline, and Newton. Much has changed since Boston College moved to this location from the South End neighborhood of Boston in 1913, but the beauty of the area’s rock ledges and nearby ponds, reservoirs and parks – along with its close proximity to the city – are still the unique characteristics of this site. Two exhibit cases feature just a sample of images from the Boston College University Archives. Numerous photographs and publications telling the story of the University from the time of its founding are available digitally. Many others are available for use in the Burns Library Reading Room. You are invited to explore these resources online or in person! </p>
