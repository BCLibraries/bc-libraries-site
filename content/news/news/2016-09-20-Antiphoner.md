<p>Using  an early 14th-century Franciscan antiphoner from the collections of  Boston College's Burns Library, this digital research presents and  contextualizes a medieval liturgical manuscript anew for both scholarly and  general audiences. Employing open source technologies to create structured data  and encode over 1500 incipits and notation in JSON and MEI/XML format, music  notation, metadata, performances and textual incipits can be queried and viewed  through a searchable interface using the <a href="https://ddmal.github.io/diva.js/">Diva.js viewer</a>. The website includes scholarly essays about the  manuscript written by Dr. Graeme Skinner (Sydney Conservatorium of Music,  University of Sydney) as well as videos of several performances from short  sections of the <a href="http://burnsantiphoner.bc.edu/performances/">manuscript</a> by Schola Antiqua (dir.  Juan Carlos Asensio Palacios), recorded in the Primate Cathedral of  St. Mary of Toledo, Spain. It received the  support of an <a href="http://www.bc.edu/offices/atab/grant.html">Academic Technology Innovation Grant</a> at Boston College (2015 – 2017). Read more about this project in the  Fall 2016 issue of the <a href="https://library.bc.edu/newsletter/?p=175">Boston College Library Newsletter</a>. </p>
