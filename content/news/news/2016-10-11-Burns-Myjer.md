<p>In 2015, UNESCO designated the four Spanish Missions in the San Antonio Missions National Park, together with the Alamo, as the 23rd World Heritage site. Ivan and his colleagues have been working on the Alamo, Mission San Jose, and Mission Concepcion since 2009, focusing primarily on the conservation of the carved stonework but also on overall building assessments.</p>
 
<p>Ivan has also executed conservation treatments here at Boston College, on buildings including St. Mary's Hall, Gasson Hall, and the Bapst Building. Since the lecture will be held in the Bapst Building, Ivan will point out areas of interest to the audience.</p>

<p>This event is co-sponsored by the New England Conservation Association and organized by NECA board members Susan Costello (Associate Conservator of Objects & Sculpture, Straus Center for Conservation & Technical Studies, Harvard Art Museums) and Barbara Adams Hebard (Conservator, John J. Burns Library, Boston College).</p>
