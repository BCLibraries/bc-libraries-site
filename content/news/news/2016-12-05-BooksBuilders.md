<em><a href="https://www.bbboston.org/">Bookbuilders of Boston</a>, a not-for-profit organization founded in 1937 to promote excellence and innovation in book publishing and manufacturing, makes annual grants to Boston College and other area universities and colleges to provide student scholarships for engagement in projects that build awareness and practical knowledge of various aspects of the publishing industry. </em>

The Boston College Libraries are seeking a BC undergraduate or graduate student interested in exhibit displays  and digital technologies to develop online versions of exhibitions. If selected for this project, you will develop technical expertise while learning about historical and cultural heritage collections.

Burns Library staff will work with you to identify previous exhibitions of rare books, manuscripts, and other special collections materials that can be transferred into an online digital publication. A listing of previous Burns Library exhibitions can be found on the <a href="http://www.bc.edu/libraries/about/exhibits-new/BurnsExhibits.html">Burns Library Archived Exhibits website</a>. 

Using digital exhibition software, you will bring these physical exhibits online in collaboration with the Libraries’ Digital Scholarship Team. You will learn best practices for curating digital content and will build a portfolio that showcases your technical and curatorial work publicly online.

An ideal candidate will demonstrate interest and ability in learning and applying new technologies, as well as an interest in public history. No computer programming skills required, but an understanding of basic HTML and CSS, as well as popular digital publishing platforms, such as Omeka or WordPress, will be helpful, but training will be provided. The stipend for this work is $3,500, and it is expected that candidate will invest up to 200 hours of time into the project overall and produce at least three online exhibits by the completion of the term. The project timeframe is flexible depending on the candidate’s availability, but will need to be completed no later than January 2018.

To apply, please send a one- to two-page statement outlining your interest and relevant background, skills and learning goals by February 1, 2017, to <a href="mailto:maureen.maclure@bc.edu">Maureen MacLure</a>. Please include your full name, class year, and contact information on a separate cover sheet. 

Interviews will take place the week of February 6. An award decision will be made by February 13. The successful candidate will be invited and expected to attend a reception for all Boston-area Bookbuilders scholarship recipients in April.
