Are you worried about the availability and preservation of publicly accessible data? Boston College will be hosting  events for <a href="http://endangereddataweek.org/" target="_blank">Endangered Data Week</a>. On April 19, our Data Refuge event will focus on pulling data.gov data & metadata for BC grants from the NEH, IMLS, NEA, and other federal agencies. NEA, NEH, and IMLS data was identified specifically because there are already a number of efforts underway to preserve science and climate change data, but no visible effort to do the same for humanities and performing arts data.
