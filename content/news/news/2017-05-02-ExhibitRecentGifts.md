Each year the collections of the Boston College Libraries benefit from the generosity and foresight of donors who created funds to support library collections. Each fall, O’Neill Library bibliographers work with faculty across the disciplines to select materials fitting the guidelines of each fund. Often, this is the only way that the Libraries can acquire these important, expensive resources. Materials purchased this year range from e-book collections from major scholarly publishers (e.g. GeoScienceWorld), Latin American newspaper collections from Readex, backfiles of important journals (Springer and Wiley) and popular magazines (Women’s Magazine Archive, Collection 1) to unique primary text resources (e.g. Colonial America and Early Arabic Printed Books). As this selection shows, all purchases significantly enrich the collections and enhance the resources available to Boston College students and researchers.
