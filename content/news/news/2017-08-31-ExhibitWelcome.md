Along with Baldwin, the feathery guy in the first case, we want to help introduce you to Boston College, to living in Boston … and give you some tips on getting used to college life. In addition to tips on BC services to help you settle in academically and socially, you’ll also glimpse some BC history depicted over the years in The Heights. Start to learn about sports, BC-style, but you’ll also find some tips on getting to know your new home, Boston. There’s so much to explore and navigate, ranging from dorm-life, college classes and expectations, but also the “T” and the wider world beyond the college gates on Comm Ave. Check out (really, check out!) the books on the nearby cart to do more exploring.
