Covering the years of 1869 to 1905, the Reeves family diaries record the daily lives of a South Boston household, as written by Dexter Reeves Sr. and Jr. Both kept daily logs of the weather as well as neighborhood happenings, correspondence, and visits made and received. Other interesting topics include lectures, concerts, religious services, and even seances attended by both father and son.
