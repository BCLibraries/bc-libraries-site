In our culture we are confronted with idealized images of beauty. Glimpses of these images circulate in media, movies, cell phones, and so on. Seen out of context, and placed in abstracted spaces motivates a different engagement with the vignettes of faces. 

These works individually have passages that function in extremes displays of gaining or deflecting attention. It is an attempt to visually mesmerize and an attempt at seamless uniformity out of dissidence.  Detached, these passages of faces, mask, by blending in with the substrate or veils, to the point of near invisibility. 

Fragmenting seduction or image of desire, I think, makes the experience for  viewers more conflicting and intriguing, hopefully inspiring questions for their own personal experience and participation with similar images.  By seeing these faces out of context, opens the door for the viewer to engage with their imagination.
