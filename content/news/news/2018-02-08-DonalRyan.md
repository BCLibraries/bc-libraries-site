For his Boston College debut, award-winning novelist and short story author Donal Ryan will read from a selection of works. The Boston Globe put The Spinning Heart on its U.S. bestseller list and has called his latest achievement, All We Shall Know, “a dwarf star of a novel: small, dark, impressively dense”—an allusion to how the central character interprets her confessional narrative around the life cycle of stars, “collapsed in on their own completeness, becoming heavier and heavier until they supernova and cease to exist.” Donal’s forthcoming novel, From a Low and Quiet Sea, scheduled for release by Penguin Random House in July, tells the story of three men, each searching for something they have lost: a lover, a brother, a Syrian homeland.
