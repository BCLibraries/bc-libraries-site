In diaries, letters, photographs, and poetry, Boston College students have responded to the current events of their day. This selection of material from the University Archives represents only a few of those moments, but its authors and subjects–who were serving in the military, confronting racial strife, or grappling with difficult choices–allow us to cultivate a connection through time.
