How did Catholicism sound in the early modern period? What kinds of sonic cultures developed within the diverse and dynamic matrix of early modern Catholicism? And what do we learn about early modern Catholicism by attending to its sonic manifestations? Editors Daniele V. Filippi and Michael Noone have brought together a variety of studies — ranging from processional culture in Bavaria to Roman confraternities, and catechetical praxis in popular missions — that share an emphasis on the many and varied modalities and meanings of sonic experience in early modern Catholic life.
