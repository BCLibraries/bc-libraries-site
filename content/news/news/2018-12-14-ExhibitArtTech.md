In <strong><em>Art & Digital Technology</em></strong>, a studio art course taught by professor Karl Baden from the Art, Art History, and Film Department, students combine text and image to produce a variety of design and art-oriented pieces, including book and magazine spreads, posters, advertisements and CD covers, using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator as creative tools. This exhibition consists of excerpts from the students' final projects.
