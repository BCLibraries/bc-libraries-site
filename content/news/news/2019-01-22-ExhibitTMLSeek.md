Jesuit Father Daniel Berrigan and theologian and civil rights lawyer William Stringfellow belonged to an old American tradition -- faith-based activism.  During the tumultous 1960s and long afterward, the two friends, both hard-working, prolific authors, were also activist opponents of the war in Vietnam and campaigners for civil rights, social justice in the Christian tradition, nucelar disarmament, and the environment.

Seeking Shelter: A Story of Place, Faith and Resistance, the multi-media exhibition that tells this intriguing, moving, and timely story, made its debut on Block Island at the Island Free Library in July of 2017.  The accompanying film, Seeking Shelter, illuminates the exhibition's themes through the recollections of people who knew the story's central figures well and have deep insight into Block Island as a place and as a community.

All are welcome at the opening reception on Monday, February 4th, 2019 (snow date, Wednesday, February 6th) from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. at the Atrium Gallery of Boston College's Theology and Ministry Library.  The reception will feature a shared keynote address by Mark S. Massa, S.J., and Gardiner Shattuck, who will comment on the Berrigans and William Stringfellow respectively.  There will also be a screening of the Seeking Shelter film and talk-back with film director, Sue Hagedorn. 

The exhibition will remain in the Atrium Gallery through April 12th.  For directions and parking information, please see the Visit page on the website for the Theology and Ministry Library's website.
