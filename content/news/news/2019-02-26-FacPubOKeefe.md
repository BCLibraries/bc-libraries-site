The heart of ministry with adolescents is assisting adolescents to recognize and grow into the multiple relationships in their lives, including their relationship with God. Navigating Toward Adulthood is a work of Practical Theology that examines the project of adolescence within frameworks of developmental psychology and sociology, intersecting with Catholic theology. It is organized into four parts: the first outlines the "project of adolescence," and what a young person must undergo to become a spiritually mature and healthy adult; the second offers a definition of adulthood focusing on its social responsibilities; the third characterizes adolescence as the stage in which a person transitions from an instrumental to a relational engagement with the world; and the fourth focuses on how the Church can best respond to the resulting adolescent developmental needs.
