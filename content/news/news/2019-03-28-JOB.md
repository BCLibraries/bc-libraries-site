The Jesuit Online Bibliography is a re-envisioned, open access and fully searchable database of bibliographic records for scholarship in Jesuit Studies produced in the 21st century. This database contains more than 15,000 records of books, book chapters, journal articles, book reviews, dissertations, conference papers, and multimedia content. Records will be added on a continuous basis by an international team of project editors and voluntary contributors. The database was built using open source technology, and the code used is available in the Librariesâ€™ GitHub repository. The records in this database will also be aggregated in The Portal to Jesuit Studies, an open access resource for Jesuit research and scholarship.
