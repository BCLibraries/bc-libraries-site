Holy cards—small images of saints and shrines, often with a prayer or scripture on the reverse—have been part of Catholic life since the 15th century. These small, devotional objects have been collected as works of art, a means to learn specific prayers or scripture, reminders of spiritual life in a secular world, and other religious expressions. This exhibit, drawn from more than a dozen Burns Library collections, highlights holy cards of different styles, eras, locations, and subjects. Visit Burns Library to view this selection of holy cards on display, and perhaps stay to conduct more research on this beautiful format.
