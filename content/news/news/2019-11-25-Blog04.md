The BC Libraries Newsletter is now a blog. The first article in this new format features Tom Wall, University Librarian, beginning the semester with Ignatian reflections. You will see older articles from the newsletter, now formatted as blog entries, below his article.

New articles will appear each Monday during the fall and spring terms. Look for announcements each week (with links) on the BC Libraries home page. For those who prefer the newsletter format, a digest of each term's articles will appear at the end of each fall and spring term, linked in emails like this one.
