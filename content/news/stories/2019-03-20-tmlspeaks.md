For those engaged in ministry or those doing ministry-related research, the ability to conduct a congregational study and gather data about a local community is a critical skill in discerning the expression of a church’s mission. For this second annual TML Speaks event, School of Theology and Ministry faculty, Hosffman Ospino and Theresa O’Keefe, will discuss how they use data in their work in practical theology, and Barbara Mento and Allison Xu will discuss the services, resources, and visualization tools that the Boston College Libraries and other data support partners offer to help students and faculty with both qualitative and quantitative research projects.
