                                <p>In August 2005, less than two years after losing his mother and father to cancer-dying six days apart-Andrew McAleer was diagnosed with fourth-stage melanoma. Less than three years later, at age forty-one, fulfilling a lifelong dream to serve his nation, he graduated from Army Basic Combat Training. At age forty-four, holding the rank of sergeant, he would go on to complete a tour of duty in Afghanistan as a U.S. Army Historian. A few months after returning from Afghanistan, McAleer was again diagnosed with fourth-stage melanoma. This time four doctors told him it was inoperable. In <em>Positive Results</em>, Andrew McAleer shares his personal, heartfelt, and inspiring stories about his fifteen-year battle with cancer, first as a caretaker and then as a patient.</p>

                <p>The Faculty Publication Highlights series features recent publications by Boston College faculty. While it is likely that monographs will figure largely among these publications, the Libraries are also eager to promote other faculty productions such as significant journal articles, paintings, musical compositions, and movies.</p>
