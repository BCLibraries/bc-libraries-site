                                <p>In Sammy Chong's own words "the worthiness of a work of art relies on its capacity to express human feelings, thoughts, and situations. Artists throughout the ages have longed for meaning in their lives, their artwork, and the world in general. In a conscious or unconscious way, they have struggled to find answers to their existential questions, which ultimately became a spiritual quest.  My art practice connects with this rich artistic heritage that usually brings forward philosophical, poetic, and theological considerations. As my artwork unveils transcendental views and concerns, it aims to light a spark that may lead viewers to search for meaning in their own paths."   </p>

                <p>The Faculty Publication Highlights series features recent publications by Boston College faculty. While it is likely that monographs will figure largely among these publications, the Libraries are also eager to promote other faculty productions such as significant journal articles, paintings, musical compositions, and movies.</p>
