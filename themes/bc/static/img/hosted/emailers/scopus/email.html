                <p>Dear  Member of the Boston College Community,<br />
                  
                <p>I  am writing today to tell you about a new project underway in the Boston College  Libraries. Beginning January 1st, members of the Boston  College community have access to a one-year long trial of <a href="http://www.scopus.com.proxy.bc.edu/"><strong>Scopus</strong></a>. Scopus is a multidisciplinary database that  provides keyword, author and affiliation searching, along with journal  analysis. While similar in many ways to the <a href="http://libguides.bc.edu/go.php?c=1589148"><strong>Web  of Science</strong></a> database, it is  larger and offers an easy, intuitive interface for author and affiliation  searching. Each database's subject coverage varies by discipline and even  sub-discipline. &nbsp;Both databases can be accessed from the <a href="http://bc.edu/databases">Boston College  Libraries' Databases</a> page.</p>
                <p>Both  databases offer:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Wide-ranging exploratory research       searching</li>
                  <li>Identification of potential       collaborators at Boston College and beyond</li>
                  <li>Scholarly productivity analysis,       such as H-Index analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                  <li>Journal &quot;impact&quot; comparison tools,       which can be useful in identifying potential journal publication targets</li>
                  <li>Ability       to discover funding sources</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We  ask your help with the goal of identifying the best resources for Boston  College. &nbsp;&nbsp;We request that you use each database in your research and  teaching, and tell us what you think, by providing feedback in a survey later  this semester and, for a small number of you, in focus groups. &nbsp;We will be  offering ample training opportunities for all. We'll also be offering a  graduate student stipend for a small group of students to work with us on  research projects in their fields, comparing results from each database and how  each serves their needs.</p>
                <p>Again,  please take this&nbsp;<strong>opportunity&nbsp;</strong>to explore both of these  important tools; having your feedback will be critical to our making a wise  decision for future access.</p>
                <p>If  you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact your<a href="http://libguides.bc.edu/ask-a-librarian/contact">&nbsp;subject  specialist</a>, or email the members of the  task force&nbsp;charged with this investigation (<a href="mailto:scopustf-ggroup@bc.edu">scopustf-ggroup@bc.edu</a>);&nbsp;they have set up a&nbsp;<a href="http://library.bc.edu/scopusfeedback">Scopus  Feedback</a>&nbsp;form, which I would  encourage you to use.</p>
                <p>With  my best wishes for a good semester,</p>
